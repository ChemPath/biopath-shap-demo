# BioPath: Cultural Bias-Corrected Therapeutic Validation

![BioPath SHAP Analysis](assets/diagrams/biopath_shap_explanation.png)

> **Revolutionary SHAP-based bias detection ensuring â‰¥30% traditional knowledge representation in therapeutic validation decisions**

## ðŸŽ¯ What Makes BioPath Different

**Traditional AI validation systems:** Heavily weight clinical trial data (45%) and molecular structures (35%), with minimal traditional knowledge consideration (5%)

**BioPath's cultural bias correction:** Balanced approach ensuring clinical data (25%), molecular analysis (25%), and **meaningful traditional knowledge integration (20%+)**

### Key Innovation: Explainable Cultural Bias Detection

Our SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework provides transparent insight into how traditional knowledge influences therapeutic validation decisions, ensuring ethical integration without cultural appropriation.
