## Understanding AI Bias Against Traditional Knowledge

### What is Cultural Bias in AI?

AI systems often systematically exclude or misrepresent traditional knowledge because they are trained primarily on Western scientific data. This digital bias perpetuates historical patterns of knowledge extraction and cultural dismissal.

**Example of AI Bias:**
- **Traditional Knowledge**: "Willow bark tea relieves pain and inflammation"
- **AI System Response**: "No scientific evidence" (ignoring centuries of traditional use)
- **Reality**: Willow bark contains salicin, the precursor to aspirin

### How Bias Affects Communities

**Knowledge Dismissal**
- Traditional remedies labeled as "unproven" despite generations of successful use
- Indigenous botanical knowledge excluded from health recommendations
- Cultural practices misrepresented or ignored in digital health systems

**Economic Impact**
- Pharmaceutical companies profit from traditional knowledge without community benefit
- Traditional healers' expertise undervalued in healthcare systems
- Communities excluded from economic opportunities based on their knowledge

**Cultural Harm**
- Traditional knowledge portrayed as "primitive" or "unscientific"
- Young people losing confidence in traditional practices
- Cultural knowledge transmission disrupted by digital bias

## Community Empowerment Tools

### Understanding AI Decision-Making

BioPath provides transparent tools that show **how** AI systems make decisions about traditional knowledge, helping communities:

**Identify Bias**
```
Traditional Knowledge Input: "Echinacea strengthens immune system"

AI System Analysis:
- Clinical Trial Data: 35% weight (limited studies)
