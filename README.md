# BioPath: Cultural Bias-Corrected Therapeutic Validation

![BioPath SHAP Analysis](assets/diagrams/biopath_shap_explanation.png)

> **Proof-of-concept SHAP-based bias detection framework ensuring ‚â•30% traditional knowledge representation in therapeutic validation decisions**

## üéØ What Makes BioPath Different

**Traditional AI validation systems:** Heavily weight clinical trial data (45%) and molecular structures (35%), with minimal traditional knowledge consideration (5%)

**BioPath's proposed approach:** Balanced framework ensuring clinical data (25%), molecular analysis (25%), and **meaningful traditional knowledge integration (20%+)**

### Key Innovation: Explainable Cultural Bias Detection

Our SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework provides transparent insight into how traditional knowledge influences therapeutic validation decisions, ensuring ethical integration without cultural appropriation.

)

result = validator.validate_therapeutic(
    traditional_knowledge=ethnobotanical_data,
    clinical_data=trial_results,
    explain=True
)
```

### Example 2: Deployment Mode Optimization

**Planned Ethical Framework:**
```python
validator = TherapeuticValidator(
    equipath_enabled=True,
    compensation_rate=0.15,  # 15% of validation value
    cultural_attribution=True
)

# Proposed blockchain-verified fair compensation system
```
