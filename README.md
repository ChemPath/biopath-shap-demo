# BioPath: Explainable AI for Traditional Medicine Validation

**Natural Compound Bioactivity Prediction with Cultural Awareness**

🏛️ Cloak & Quill Research - 501(c)(3) Public Charity  
🎯 Mission: Bridge traditional knowledge and modern AI through transparent, explainable bioactivity analysis

## 🚨 The Problem: Black Box AI Fails Traditional Medicine

Current AI systems for drug discovery treat traditional medicine as data points without understanding cultural context. When machine learning models predict bioactivity, they can't explain **why** traditional remedies work or give proper credit to the knowledge systems that identified them first.

**The result**: Traditional knowledge gets validated by AI but knowledge holders receive no recognition or compensation.
