# BioPath SHAP Demo: Explainable Natural Compound Bioactivity Prediction

## Overview

This repository demonstrates advanced explainable AI techniques for natural compound bioactivity prediction, showcasing the intersection of traditional knowledge and modern machine learning. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we provide transparent insights into how molecular features contribute to therapeutic potential predictions.

## 🧬 Key Features

- **Molecular Feature Engineering**: Advanced calculation of molecular descriptors and fingerprints
- **Ensemble Bioactivity Prediction**: Multi-model approach for robust predictions
- **Custom SHAP Explainer**: Domain-specific explanations tailored for biological data
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Clear, publication-ready plots for feature importance
- **Traditional Knowledge Integration**: Framework for validating ethnobotanical insights

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Drug Discovery**: Identify promising natural compounds for further development
- **Traditional Medicine Validation**: Scientifically validate traditional therapeutic claims
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Provide explainable predictions for regulatory submissions
- **Research Collaboration**: Bridge traditional knowledge holders with modern research
